# Kubelet CGroups memory fix

Minimal loop to reconcile `kubepods.slice` memory limits against an expected value.
This script is implemented and tested for OpenShift 3.11 and RHEL 7 only.

The expected limit is calculated using the formula `SYS_TOTAL_MEMORY - RESERVED_MEMORY`.

## Background
This is a mitigation script for the issue described in Bugzilla [1814804](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1814804) and fixed with 
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release **3.11.219**. The update includes the PR [24568](https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/24568) to 
fix Bug 1802687.

Users who haven't already applied the suggested latest release of OCP 3.11 can use it to mitigate
the bug before patching. **It is strongly advised to patch at the latest release ASAP**.

## Install
To install as a systemd unit on the host run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/giannisalinetti/kubelet-cg-fix.git
$ cd kubelet-cg-fix
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

## Monitor status
The scripts tracks and logs the changes on the memory limit of kubepods.slice. To view the status:
```
$ sudo systemctl status kubelet-cg-fix.service
```

## Verify updated status
To verify the updated memory limits:
```
$ sudo systemctl status kubepods.slice
```

## Test memory hog
The file `test/kill-node.yaml` runs a hog pod that quickly saturates the memory of the node, causing
the kubelet to become unreachable for > 10m.
To test the behavior of the fix:
```
$ oc create ns kill-node
$ oc create -f test/kill-node.yaml -n kill-node
```

Watch for the `kubepods.slice` resources and verify that the hog pod is evicted or OOMKilled when the CGroups `memory.limits_in_bytes` value is reached.
The test manifest was provided on Bugzilla [1800319](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1800319).
